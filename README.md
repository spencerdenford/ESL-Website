# ESL-Website
Example design for a company called ALERT who analyze different aspects of English as a Second Language in Canada. 

Originally created as a project for a class in university had us look at the scociological, philosophical and theoretical impacts of ESL in Canada. 
While the project was the essays on these subjects, I created this website for users in the class to more easily digest the information. 

Since the website was developed for a non-computer science class, I decided not to use anything too complicated. 
Therefore, the majority of this project consists of HTML, JavaScript and CSS only. 

home.html is intended to be the main homepage of the website, while clicking on the links on the page will take you to other pages, stored in the extra file. 

Thank you for checking out the project!
