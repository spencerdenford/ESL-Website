                <p>
                    There are several ways in which people acquire their first language and second language. This learning process creates many distinctions between both the first language known as L1, and their second language known as L2. L1 indicates a person’s native language, primary language or their mother tongue. This language is one that is acquired during the individual’s early childhood, usually before the age of three, and involves people who speak the same language. On the other hand, L2 indicates people that are learning a language using their L1 which they learned as a child. It also focuses on the process of learning that particular language. Since it can be said that there are many links between the L1 and L2 learning phenomenon, several researchers have categoried them into different theoretical models such as the innatinist, behaviourist, cognitivist and interactionist models of learning english as a second language (Mohamad Nor & Rashid, 2018).

                <p id="header">Innatist Perspective</p>
                <p>
                    The Innatinist theory comprises the idea that learning is conceptualized within a person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Stephan Krashen, he defines the differences between acquisition and learning a language such as English, in which he developed a five step model for this theory:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acquisition-learning hypothesis,</li>
                    <li>Monitor hypothesis,</li>
                    <li>Natural order hypothesis,</li>
                    <li>Input hypothesis and,</li>
                    <li>Affective filter hypothesis</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>
                    This video does a good job of explaining his five step model in this video here:

                <p id="header">Interactionist Perspective</p>
                <p>
                    The interactionist theory of learning states that learning occurs when you are interacting with others and speaking english fluently with those around you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its focus is specifically applied to the aspect of social interaction, and how others can learn from them
                </p>
                <p>
                    These language structures that are understood by others around you may affect the way in which an individual's processes this information and can lead to some errors in the interpretations and understanding of language acquisitions. 
                </p>
                
                <p id="header">Behavioural Perspective</p>
                <p>
                    The behavioural learning theory follows on the idea that language is learned and practiced. This can be through memorization, or practicing it over and over again until it comes natural to the individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The behaviourist theory involves the use of two types of conditioning, such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning when learning and acquiring english as a second language.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classical conditioning - Occurs when there is a conditioned response to an object or situation, and it is usually linked to another stimulus making it seen to be as a natural reflex reaction. An example of this is when parents are teaching their children manners, they may teach them to say thank you and please when in need of something and train them by giving them candy. Overtime, children will associate using these manners without the need to be reminded or associating it with something else.</li>
                    <li>Operant conditioning - Occurs when a response is demonstrated in terms of expecting some kind of reward or reinforcement. This method of learning a language is especially seen to be used in the L2 learning acquisition, and is used by teachers and other instructors in training people's ability to learn L2 learning successfully. In a classroom setting, a teacher may present a candy or reward when a correct answer is given, and punishment of any sort if an inaccurate answer is given (positive and negative reinforcement.)</li>
                </ul>

                <p id="header">Cognitivist Perspective</p>
                <p>
                    Cognitivism is a learning theory that focuses on forms and ways to how information is received, organized, stored, and retrieved by individuals. When observing the cognitive perspective in an adult learning environment such as ESL, instruction should be organized, sequenced, and presented in a manner that is understandable and meaningful to the learning. Cognitivism focuses on retention and recall through the use of quality teaching practices

                <p id="header">Conclusion</p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, there are multiple theories and methods that are used when acquiring, reading or learning a second language such as English. These theories consist of the innatist perspective, interactionist perspective, behavioural perspective and cognitivist perspective. According to many researchers, there is no specific way in which language can be learned or acquired as there are different methods and theories used for various situations in which they can be applied. At times, these theories may also be interconnected to one another depending on the circumstances in which language is used.
