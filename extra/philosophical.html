                <p id="header">Intro</p>
                <p>
                    The question is not whether English as a second language is beneficial or unbeneficial, but whether you know how, for what purpose, what kind, and in what language situation a particular method is used to enhance one's learning effectively. English is not the first language for many individuals, people who immigrate to Canada may experience language barriers in certain situations. Each individual requires a unique approach in language teaching methodology. Different types of learning philosophies help individuals develop learning styles that will benefit them in teaching and in their educational career.

                <p id="header">Epistemology study</p>
                <p>
                    Epistemology focuses on the philosophical study of the nature, origin and limits of human knowledge. TESL encourages educators to excel in their work and are given equal opportunities. Their values focus on research and scholarship in the teaching and learning ESL, and Equality of employment opportunity for qualified non-native English-speaking and native English-speaking teachers. These learning values are considered guided principles for adult educators to incorporate within their work.
                </p>
                
                <p id="header">Methods:</p>
                <p id="header">Liberal approach</p>
                <p>
                    This qualitative approach consists of the intellectual development and specific course designs to strengthen critical thinking and excel in logic.The learning plans in this approach focus on knowledge and enhancement of intellectual abilities. TESL has different types of learning plans that focus on different goals. The educator is considered the “expert” who is in control of the learning process with complete authority. Methods can include lectures, study groups, and discussion. 
                </p>
                
                <p id="header">Humanistic approach</p>
                <p>
                    The study of people and the uniqueness of individuals is what leads to the humanistic approach. This approach assumes that understanding basic human behaviour can only be done by studying humans, due to the assumption that all individuals are unique and will maximize their potential in their own way. Humanistic theory encourages individuals to realize one's full potential. There are many factors that can affect second language learning. Their language ego, which is the relation between peoples feelings of personal identity, individual uniqueness, and value and aspects of their first language. Also empathy, which is the ability to share someone else's feelings or experiences by imaging what it would be like to be in that person's situation. In adult learning, one should be aware of the learning objectives and the use of learning strategies to interact and share information, exchange ideas and opinions and work together by committing errors. Language teaching is more effective when teachers provide the development of a positive self-image. This can be done by sorting success oriented tasks and also in creating a supportive environment.

                <p id="header">Progressive approach</p>
                <p>
                    Progressive education was first introduced by an American philosopher named John Dewy. Dewey argued that education should not simply involve making students learn mindless facts that they would soon forget (Kennedy, 2020). Progressive education’s main approach is to teach through experiences rather than facts. Learning from experiences allows individuals to understand the content better than simple memorization. Hands on learning has the capability to enhance the learners mind by actively stimulating the brain and engage in activities. This approach helps individuals develop their critical thinking skills and preps them for real life situations.

                <p id="header">How can TESL incorporate progressive approach within the education system? </p>
                <p>
                    TESL can use these different learning philosophies to enhance their teaching schemes and quality of education. These approaches can be combined through various ways such as using these approaches in conferences, initiatives, workshops and within the classroom setting.
