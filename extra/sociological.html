                <p>
                    People who immigrate to Canada experience many challenges with adapting to a new home and finding employment. These challenges can be made more severe by the language barriers many of them experience as they attempt to become successful and productive members of society. A lack of training in the English or French language can dramatically impair their ability to find work, attend school, meet friends, or even order a meal. All this, in the end, can lead to them experiencing a frustrating lack of identity. The ESL (English as a Second Language) movement was an attempt to assist non-English speakers by providing them greater access to certified training programs which help to alleviate these challenges.
                </p>

                <p id="header">Historically</p>
                <p>
                    Before we can fully understand English as a Second Language and its impacts on individuals, we must first understand how language is designated and classified. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language that you speak naturally is considered your first language, any subsequent languages that are acquired or learned are classified as a second language. Stern defined one’s first language as “the first language that comes to one’s mind when one is speaking under the most spontaneous conditions possible. Thus[,] one’s first language may vary over the major phases of the sociolinguistic trajectory of one’s lifetime.”(Stern, 2016)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within Canada, there are three (3) classifications of language; Charter, Immigration, and Ancestral (defined as Indigenous peoples) languages. Charter language is protected under the federal Official Languages act of 1969 for both English and French, whereas Immigration and Ancestral languages do not have the same protection (Canadian Encyclopedia). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “For immigrants to English-speaking Canada, for example, learning English is a necessary prerequisite for economic survival. It was not until after the Second World War that provincial governments created language and citizenship programs for adult newcomers, that school boards established language classes for immigrant children, and that the growth of community colleges led to the development of post-secondary ESL programs. By the early 1970s, teachers of ESL had founded a number of provincial ESL associations, and in 1978, TESL Canada, a nationwide federation of associations involved in teaching ESL, was created.” (Stern, 2016)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following World War II, Canada experienced a drastic increase in immigration, and a Citizenship Act was passed in 1947. This Act considered the responsibilities of each party (immigrant and nation) to provide an effective transition to citizenship. This led to the funding of The Citizen Instruction and Language Textbook, which was in use until the mid-eighties (Derwing, 2017).
                </p>
                <p>
                    TESL Canada was formed in 1978. The TESL committee produced the Six Principles document, which identified key components of the program:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>accessibility to ESL for all newcomers</li>
                    <li>flexibility and sufficiency</li>
                    <li>national, provincial, and local coordination</li>
                    <li>support for community agencies</li>
                    <li>functional Canadian orientation and citizenship content in ESL material</li>
                    <li>recognition of key roles of the ESL professional and the ESL profession (Derwing, 2017)</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>
                    These 6 Principles helped lead to a greater focus on the development of the individual into a “good citizen,” helping them adjust to their new life in an academic, economic, and perhaps most importantly, social approach.
                </p>

                <p id="header">Emotional Impacts</p>
                <p>
                    While this movement did help alleviate some of the challenges faced by immigrants, it was not a “cure-all” for them. A survey in 2016 delved into the raw emotions that they experience when confronted by this language barrier. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When asked to respond to how they felt when trying to communicate in their new setting, non-english speakers expressed a general frustration. It made them feel “like a child who is learning to talk, stressed, stupid, lost, challenged, terrible, lonely, afraid, restricted to using their hands to communicate, negative body language from the person they are speaking to (that makes them want to shut down), sad, nervous, angry, useless, powerless, depressed, and bad.”(Leadership and Civil Engagement, 2018)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In essences, the newcomers were ashamed of themselves for not adapting quickly enough. They also felt “limited and uncomfortable around English speakers.” (LCE, 2018) This being the majority of those they came into contact with either at school, the workplace, or even while going out for a meal. They feel limited and uncomfortable almost everywhere they go, all the time.  Student, Yui Okamoto, described these emotions she experienced attempting to communicate in a new language as frustrating because “communication is indispensable to life.” (Okamoto, 2019)

                </div>
                <p>
                    This shame manifests itself in a feeling of failure. Many of them say that their greatest wish is “to wake up being fluent and speaking English without an accent 'like a real Canadian'.” (LCE, 2018) This illustrates how much of a positive impact that ESL programs can potentially have on newcomers to Canada. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this movement has led to myriad improvements, there is still much work to be done. Teacher training can be improved by a closer examination and a better understanding  of the emotions that immigrants feel. It would be a helpful enterprise for all teachers to experience, for just one day, the same helplessness these people feel everyday of their lives.  
                </p>

                <p id="header">Statistical Data</p>
                <p>
                    In Toronto alone, approximately 44% of residents speak a mother tongue other than English (Ministry of Finance, Government of Ontario, 2016). If this part of the population had no way of learning English, they would have a harder time coexisting in the same settings as native English speakers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not knowing English can make living in Canada challenging. While many immigrants live in households and communities where their native language may be more common, there may be little opportunity to branch out to become more integrated members of society. According to the Toronto Immigration Employment Data Initiative, immigrants who have better skills in English or French have a higher chance of gaining high-skilled jobs than those with little ability in either language (V Preston, M Akbar, M Phan, S Park, P Kelly, 2011). This proves that being able to learn English can greatly improve an individual’s outreach and opportunity in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When immigrants gain employment in Canada, there is often a disproportionate wage gap. First generation immigrants who do not speak English at home earn approximately 27% less than non-immigrants, while second generation immigrants who do not speak English at home earn approximately 46% less than non-immigrants (A Magesan, 2021). This wage gap can limit Canadians even more, affecting their dignity, their opportunities and inclusion, as well as their reliance and security (Statistics Canada, Government of Canada, 2020).

                <p>
                    An individual’s experience learning English can be affected by what culture or background they come from. In some cases, background can influence the methods and ability to learn English. For instance, some languages are based on Latin alphabets and thus serve as an advantage for learners who speak those languages. From the list above, native Italian or Spanish speakers are already familiar with Latin characters, where native Chinese and Cantonese speakers would have less commonalities to rely on. (R Treiman, I Levin, B Kessler, 2006)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Statistically speaking there are major advantages to being an English-speaking Canadian. There are more opportunities for work, better paying jobs, and a more accepting social environment. Giving Canadians a chance to learn English can play a pivotal role in an immigrant’s experience as a Canadian, which is why ESL programs are greatly beneficial to society.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    While not knowing English can be a major disadvantage for Canadians, there are solutions out there. TESL (Teachers of English as a Second Language) Canada offers methods and strategies to teach English effectively. Defining national standards of teaching, TESL strives to give educators the means necessary to create opportunities for all Canadians to learn English, regardless of background or status (TESL Canada, n.d.). Although their mission is helpful to Canadian society, both the educators and the learners have problems to face.

                                Many school boards have continuous intake, allowing learners to join at any

                                welcomed back, whenever it is possible to accommodate them. Adult education programs hold classes not only in schools, but also in a variety of community venues such as libraries and community centres. Yet some barriers are
                                more difficult to remove, such as those arising from lack of transportation or
                                affordable day care. CESBA is working at all levels of government to remove

                    English as a second language programs serve as a primary tool in helping non-English speaking immigrants assimilate into Canadian culture. Despite the problems that exist in the ELS programs, educators need to do everything in their power to address them in an effective manner.

                <p id="header">Conclusion</p>
                <p>
                    The English as a second language movement is aimed at assisting non-English speaking immigrants to assimilate into Canadian culture. Moving to a new country is challenging enough, not knowing English can greatly affect one’s experience in Canada, leading to frustration, lack of opportunities, and impacting quality of life. ESL programs in Canada provide people with the ability to learn the nation’s official language, give reach into Canadian culture, government differences, rights as a Canadian and more; all things that can lead to a more progressive and inclusive society in Canada.
